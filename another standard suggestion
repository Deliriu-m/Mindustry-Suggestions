Now I am thinking of core units 
this is going against one of your things. Not having a core mounted gun or whatever it is.
But once these units are Bolt down the core mounted gun will then disappear
and because these core are so heavy filled with resources they can only use tracks like tank tracks.
That's my idea anyways it's obviously going to take a lot of resources
but what the player has the enemies can have two.
